# Booking-System
A role-based booking system built in Python with a Tkinter GUI and MySQL backend. Includes secure login flow, user authentication, real-time data display, validation logic, and error-handling to ensure data integrity and system reliability.  (Currently trying to recover the project from my old laptop, it will be published once its been found)
